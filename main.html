                This application is designed to help notice ringers get used to call changes. It is based off a <a
                    href=https://codepen.io/orchestrali/full/wvXzVGq>similiar application by Alison Stevens</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Call changes are a type of ringing where a conductor calls out which bells should swap places.
                A conductor will generally keep track of the whole row,
                but as an individual ringer you don't have to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
                You do need to know:
            <ol>
                <li>your own bell number</li>
                <li>the bell you are currently following</li>
                <li>ideally the bell two places ahead of you, if there is one</li>
            </ol>
            It can also be helpful to keep track of what place you're in.

            There are two different styles of calling, you should find out which is used in your tower.

            <h4>Calling up</h4>
            <p>Starting from rounds, if you're the 3, here are the three calls that affect you.</p>
            <p>1. "3 to 4": you move UP (later) one place and follow the 4. The 4 will now follow the bell you *were*
                following,
                the 2, which is good to remember if you can.
            </p>
            <p>2. "2 to 3": you move DOWN (earlier) one place and follow the bell that the 2 was following, the 1. This
                is
                why
                it's useful to know which bell is two places ahead!
            </p>
            <p>3. "1 to 2": you stay in the same place but 1 and 2 swap under you. You were following the 2, but the 1
                was
                just
                called to follow the 2 so now you follow the 1.</p>
            <p>If a call doesn't include your number OR the number of the bell you're currently following, it doesn't
                affect
                you.</p>
            <h4>Calling down</h4>
            <p>Starting from rounds, if you're the 3, here are the three calls that affect you.</p>
            <p>1. "3 to 1": you move DOWN (earlier) one place to follow the 1.</p>
            <p>2. "4 to 2": you move UP (later) one place to follow the 4, the bell that's been called to follow the
                bell
                you
                *were* following.</p>
            <p>3. "2 to lead": you stay in place but the 1 and 2 swap below you. You now follow the 1 which was two
                places
                ahead. This is why it's useful to know which bell that was, though the most important thing is to keep
                ringing
                steadily in the same place!</p>
